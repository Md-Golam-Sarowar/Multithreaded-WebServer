# Multithreaded-WebServer
This project implements multithreaded webserver using the concept of socket programming and concept of threadpool to negotiate with concurrent requests at a specific time using c programming. This project has been implemented as well as executed in Ubuntu. So to run this project follow the steps mentioned below:
*open your Ubuntu terminal
*go to the repository where you have stored all these files to run
*Now run the command " gcc -o threadpool_test threadpool_test.c -lpthread "
*After that execute this " ./threadpool_test "
*now run this command " ./server 8080 ./ & "
So you are done and go to any of your browser and paste " http://127.0.0.1:8080 " to your address bar and hit enter.
So this is all you have to do. Thank you.
